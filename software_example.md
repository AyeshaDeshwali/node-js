# Software and Types of Software

Software is a group of programs. Computers understand only machine language, neither assembly language nor high-level language.

Programs or software is written in assembly language or high-level language.

To translate these programs into machine language, a translator is used, such as a compiler, interpreter, or assembler.

Software is an important part of a computer. Without software, a computer cannot perform any task.
